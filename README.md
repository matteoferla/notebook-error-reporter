# remote-notebook-error-collection

> :construction: WIP: This is not complete.

An idea on how to collect errors generated by other users using a notebook that was shared.

I have a few notebooks that I have shared on Twitter and 
I occasionally get an email telling if the repo they use is broken
or there is a case that causes an error.
Similar in concept to Sentry.io, I would like to know when error happen.

Hence a cell magic that captures and error sends the most anonymous data to an address.

## Slack
The easiest way is getting slacked on error to a channel.
A Slack webhook is easy to set up (just remember the subdomain to do so is api not app).

```python
import os
os.environ['SLACK_WEBHOOK'] = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXXX"

from notebook_error_reporter import ErrorSlack
es = ErrorSlack(os.environ['SLACK_WEBHOOK'])
es.load_ipython_extension()
```

A regular cell does nothing. But one that is not successful will send a Slack message.

    {"error_name": "ValueError", 
     "error_message": "foo", 
     "traceback": [{"filename": "foo.py",
                    "fun_name": "run_code", 
                    "lineno": 666}, 
                    ...
                   ], 
     "first_line": "# cell that does foo",
     "execution_count": 111}

The 'filename' is stripped of the dist-packages path, 
because the `dist-packages` path in colab may have a username that _could_ have personal identifiable data.

## Store

An alternative option is storing the error details `error_details`.
```
from notebook_error_reporter import ErrorStore
es = ErrorStore()
es.load_ipython_extension()
es.error_details
```


## Issues
Two issues are a problem:

* Anonynimity and full transparency
* Abuse

I only want to send the error type, the error message, the notebook name and the cell.
The code therefore should not contain error codes raise someone's password or credit card number.
In the scientific context I don't think this should be a problem.
But the code should have full transparency.

If a Slack webhook is used, there are users that search GitHub for exposed webhooks 
and spam with adverts for their cybersecurity courses.
Also a single prankster user could make it really annoying.
Therefore, a server needs to be set up ideally to collect this...
