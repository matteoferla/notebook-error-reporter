# remote-notebook-error-collection

> :construction: WIP: This is not complete.

An idea on how to collect errors generated by other users using a notebook that was shared.

I have a few notebooks that I have shared on Twitter and 
I occasionally get an email telling if the repo they use is broken
or there is a case that causes an error.
Similar in concept to Sentry.io, I would like to know when error happen.

Hence a cell magic that captures and error sends the most anonymous data to an address.

## Issues
Two issues are a problem:

* Anonynimity and full transparency
* Abuse

I only want to send the error type, the error message, the notebook name and the cell.
The code therefore should not contain error codes raise someone's password or credit card number.
In the scientific context I don't think this should be a problem.
But the code should have full transparency.

If a Slack webhook is used, there are users that search GitHub for exposed webhooks 
and spam with adverts for their cybersecurity courses.
Also a single prankster user could make it really annoying.
Therefore, a server needs to be set up ideally to collect this...
